## Overview

This challenge is to build out an advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com). It will display the Advice #, and advice text upon loading the page.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
